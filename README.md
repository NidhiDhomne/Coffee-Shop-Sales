# Coffee-Shop-Sales
Welcome to my Coffee Shop Sales Dashboard project! This repository showcases a comprehensive dashboard that I created in Excel to analyze and visualize sales data from a coffee shop. The dashboard provides insights into sales trends, product performance, customer behavior, and more. The dataset includes detailed sales transactions, product information, customer demographics, and employee data.
In this project, you'll find the following structure: the data/ directory contains the raw sales data files used to create the dashboard, the dashboard/ directory includes the Excel file with the sales dashboard, and the images/ directory contains screenshots of the dashboard. The dashboard features visualizations of daily, weekly, and monthly sales trends, highlights best and worst-selling products, displays customer purchasing patterns and preferences, assesses sales performance by employee, and includes interactive elements to filter data by date, product, and customer segments.
